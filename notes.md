[link-pluggable-functions]: https://codex.wordpress.org/Pluggable_Functions

- i learnt what a [pluggable function][link-pluggable-functions] is
-  i learnt how to use them in our child theme to add, remove, and manipulate content as desired
-  as of right now, at the stage i'm in with this course, and repository, it seems that the use of pluggable functions will be very common
