## Ce que j'ai appris
- i got a brief introduction to template files and learnt how to use them in the child theme
- particularly, in this commit, i learnt how to change an existing template file
  - copy the exact desired template file (as well as its path structure) from the parent theme to the child theme
  - this means that the location in which the template is found in the parent theme directory must be replicated in the child theme directory
  - from here, we can modify the code as necessary
- i am starting to see the distinctions between hooks, pluggable functions and template files
- last, but not least, we went through the template hierarchy. this is an important concept to understand. its well known diagram for explanation purposes can be found [here](https://developer.wordpress.org/files/2014/10/Screenshot-2019-01-23-00.20.04.png)
- also, wrote some styles for the authour avatar and description.
