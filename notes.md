## Ce que j'ai appris
- in this commit, i learnt how to add new template files to my child theme
- particularly, i made the template files [category-francais.php](themes/twentynineteen-child/category-francais.php) file from the parent theme's [archive.php](themes/twentynineteen/archive.php) file, and modified it as desired
  - this is the page that will list all our posts that have the category of *francais*
  - i was able to do this thanks to my eventual understanding of [template hierarchy][wp-template-hierarchy-link]
