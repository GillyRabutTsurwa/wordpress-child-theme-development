- used my javascript knowledge (translated it to PHP of-co) to conditionally display my posted-by metadata text
- lastly, i changed the person icon to the GitHub icon thanks to the help of this [lien](https://gitlab.sam.solutions/pm/dsr-property/blob/master/wp-content/themes/twentynineteen/inc/icon-functions.php)
